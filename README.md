#### _A user friendly app for tracking animals in your zoo._

#### By _**Mitchell Long**_

## Description

ZooTracker is a simple Angular application for tracking animals in a zoo. This exercise demonstrates an understanding of the basic structure and implementation of an AngularJs application. Zoo keepers can add new animals to the tracker and edit existing animals.

Each animal is tracked based on their name, species, zoo keeper, enclosure building, diet, sex, likes and dislikes. Animals can also be filtered by age.
